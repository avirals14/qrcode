## My process
At first I analysed the whole design and calculated the margins. Then implemented using HTML and CSS.
Code Editor: VS Code
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
  
### What I learned

While designing this QR code page I learned a lot of CSS Properties and also about margins.

### Continued development

I will be more practicing on CSS properties. I'll be using Frontend Mentor for further projects.

### Useful resources

https://www.google.com Google was the most useful resource while designing
